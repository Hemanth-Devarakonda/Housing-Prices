# Housing Prices in Australia
> This project involves creating advance regression models like Ridge and Lasso to predict Housing market in Australia. 


## Objective
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. To achieve this, they would need a machine learning model to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the models will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Key Aspects of the project
- The project involves preparation/clean-up of the data set.
- Understanding the data set through Exploratory Data Analysis. 
- Building Ridge regression model utilizing the GridsearchCV techniques with 5 folds.
- Building Lasso regression model utilizing the GridsearchCV techniques with 5 folds.
- Comparing both the model to decide which one can better predict and be simple.

## Conclusions
- There was minimal difference in the R2 scores in both the models.
- Due to its reduced features, Lasso regression model is recommended for any future predictions.


## Technologies Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
